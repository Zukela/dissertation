What did you find in the literature, what are you hoping to do, where is the gap and what needs to be done? What models did you use to generate those survival analysis predictions: Cox? Write the methods and results of MVA. Methods: explain the type of process you have in terms of reading the data during the kind of analysis and the type of metrics that you are interested in. What rigorous investigation do you want to do?
1.⁠ ⁠tidying the literature review to be more specific, 2. pinning down the design of your rigorous experiment, sketching that out formally, methodologically. 3. Writing up the methods and results of what you have done already.
What you are going to do and what you have done are informed by what other people have done. Find out what other people are using to analyse tabular data and what good models to use. Maybe use the method from the TCGA paper on this dataset. Sketch what types of pipelines people have. How to do preprocessing, data cleaning, and handling missing values. What type of models could be chosen? flow diagram of the pipeline and making choices along the way, and design your experiment…
For the rigours analysis, perhaps build a model and try it on different datasets to improve generalisability.  	improve model performance and interpretability. by designing the details based on what other people have tested and suggested for the future
